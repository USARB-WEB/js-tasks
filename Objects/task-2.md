# Task #2 - Working with Properties

We have an object that stores the salaries of our team:

```javascript
let salaries = {
  John: 100,
  Ann: 160,
  Pete: 130
};
```

Write code to sum all the salaries and store the result in the variable sum. The expected result should be 390.

If the salaries object is empty, the result should be 0.
