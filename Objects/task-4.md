# Task #4 - Cloning an Object
Create an object user1 with the following structure:

```javascript
let user1 = {
  name: "User 1",
  age: 123
};

```
Create an empty object user2 and copy user1 into it.
Then, modify user2 so that:

- name = "User 2"
- age = 321

Finally, print both objects to the console.

P.S. If the console prints the same values for both objects, the task is incorrect.
