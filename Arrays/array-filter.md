# Task description
Create an array that contains at least 10 numbers (the algorithm should work for any number of elements)

[1, 5, 0, -5, 30, 100, -500, 0, 100, 55]

Write the following functions to process this array and display:
- numbers < 5
- positions of elements with the maximum and minimum values
- outputs the elements of the array that have a value greater than the arithmetic mean of all elements of the array
- number of negative and positive elements in the array
