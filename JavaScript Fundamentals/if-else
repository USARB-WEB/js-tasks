# Task description
Write code that will check the correctness of {username} and {password} and display the following messages:
- "Hello {username}" if username and password match
- "Incorrect password" if username is entered correctly but password is not
- "Incorrect username" if incorrect username is entered
- "Validation Error" if nothing is entered

PS: In practice, never do this (tell the user that he entered the username or password incorrectly, but do not specify what exactly the error is, for security reasons)
